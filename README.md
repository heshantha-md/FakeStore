<h2>FakeStore iOS App Prototype</h2>
<p>Based on <a href="https://fakestoreapi.com">Fake Store API</a></P>
<p>I'm excited to share a sample app I've been working on. It's part of my journey learning <b>SwiftUI</b> and <b>SwiftData</b>, and I've dived into the cool new <b>Observation framework</b> with this one. It's a great reflection of what I've learned so far and a chance for me to get even better at iOS development. You can check out the full source code here. Would love your feedback and insights on it! Big thanks to Fake Store API team for their free API - it was a huge help in this project. Can't wait to hear what you think, and any tips or suggestions are always welcome.</P>
<p>Happy coding! ðŸš€</p>
